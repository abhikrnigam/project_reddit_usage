None of you leftists do. I remember reading leftists saying ""The Muslim Vote won\'t have much of an impact this time round, they\'ll get no seats, all their seats will go Labour"". Well, look now what? I\'m sorry but do you people really expect me to listen to you and just say ""all will be fine, everything will go back to normal"" after you were proven wrong already. We got as many Islamist MPs as Reform MPs. But ""hey, the far-right is here! So scary!"".\n\nAnd do you really think that a careless comment about Bangladeshis a few days before the election really had as much impact to them than Gaza? If a Bangladeshi Muslim had already made their mind to vote Labour by that time, then they would have just interpreted the statement in any way that their mind told them to. You clearly have no understanding about how obsessed Muslims are with Palestine. Even before October 7th, they cared about Palestine *more than anything else*. There aren\'t even that many Bangladeshis in a lot of the areas where they lost a significant amount of votes. 85% of British Muslims are not Bangladeshi and many of the 15% Bangladeshi Muslims would have not voted or were too young to vote.\n\nI\'m so sick of the blind denial and lack of acknowledgent that Islamist politics is here. Why can\'t leftists just acknowledge that they were wrong and today we are facing the same problems as a Muslim-majority country, where people vote on the basis of religious ideals like ""holy land of al-Aqsa"". Will it be when they campaign for Sharia in their local areas (that would become Muslim-majority in the future)?', 1), (""I reckon the former.

To make my point clear I'll run through some possible actions that the government could take that go beyond simple rhetoric and what effect they're likely to have.\n\n1) Give Israel an ultimatum stating that if they don't agree to an immediate ceasefire we will bad arms sales to Israel. This is the best clear action available to the government beyond rhetoric and makes a clear statement in support of peace.
